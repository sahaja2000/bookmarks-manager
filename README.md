This project was undertaken collaboratively by a team of 5 individuals as part of our college group project. Its primary objective was to gain hands-on experience in the software development lifecycle, including version control with Git and GitHub, while adhering to the agile Scrum methodology. Throughout the project, we effectively executed all Scrum rituals, such as sprint planning, daily stand-up meetings, sprint review, and sprint retrospective, ensuring seamless project management and teamwork.
